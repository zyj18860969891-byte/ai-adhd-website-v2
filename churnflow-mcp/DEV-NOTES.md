# ChurnFlow Development Notes

## Current Status: v0.4.2 Advanced Database Features & Migrations 🎉 PRODUCTION READY

**Major Achievement**: Complete database integration with clean architecture!

### v0.4.2 - Advanced Database Features & Migrations ✅ COMPLETE

- **SQLite Database Integration**: Full dual storage (files + database) with graceful fallback
- **Full-Text Search (FTS5)**: Search across all captures with ranking and relevance
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time statistics for inbox, active, completed, and overdue items
- **AI Learning Patterns**: Context inference improves over time with user feedback
- **Clean Architecture**: Database setup completely separated from capture operations
- **Production Commands**: `npm run db:setup`, `npm run db:reset`, `npm run db:studio`
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 176+ tests including full database test suite
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: Complete backwards compatibility with file-only mode

### What Works Perfectly

- **Database Integration**: Dual storage system with SQLite
  - ✅ Optional setup: Works in file-only mode when database not configured
  - ✅ Full-text search (FTS5) with proper triggers and indexing
  - ✅ Context-aware storage with relationship tracking
  - ✅ AI learning patterns for improved inference over time
  - ✅ Analytics dashboard with real-time statistics
- **Clean Architecture**: Database operations properly separated
  - ✅ Setup commands: `npm run db:setup` and `npm run db:reset`
  - ✅ Capture operations never create tables (code smell resolved)
  - ✅ Graceful degradation when database unavailable
  - ✅ Non-blocking database saves don't affect file operations
- **Comprehensive test suite**: 176+ tests across 7 suites ✅
- **Production Ready**: All existing features preserved and enhanced
  - ✅ Formatting consistency with FormattingUtils
  - ✅ Section placement and multi-item capture
  - ✅ MCP server integration and GitHub Copilot support
  - ✅ ADHD-friendly workflows with zero breaking changes

### Next Version: v0.4.3 - Capture Input Refinements 🏁

**Focus: Enhanced AI processing, multi-item capture, and edge case handling**

Planned features:

1. **Capture input refinements**: Enhanced AI processing and edge cases
2. **Priority detection**: Improved priority inference from natural language
3. **Multi-item enhancement**: Improved multi-item capture from complex inputs
4. **Edge case handling**: Better handling of ambiguous or unusual inputs
5. **Confidence scoring**: Refined confidence algorithms for routing decisions

## v0.2.2 Formatting Consistency ✅ COMPLETED

### 🎯 Goal Achieved: Complete formatting standardization with perfect section placement

**Issues RESOLVED:**

- ✅ Standardized date formats: `2025-09-16` and `2025-09-16 14:30`
- ✅ Consistent checkbox styles and entry prefixes
- ✅ Proper section headers with spacing rules
- ✅ Activity entries sorted chronologically (oldest first)
- ✅ Items placed directly under correct section headers
- ✅ Automatic section creation with proper ordering

### 📋 Formatting Standards IMPLEMENTED

**FormattingUtils Class:** 52 comprehensive tests ✅

- ISO date/timestamp formats
- Priority indicators (🚨 ⏫ 🔼 🔻)
- Entry templates for all types
- Validation and standardization methods

**Section Placement:** 12 comprehensive tests ✅  

- Proper blank line spacing (1 before/after headers, none between items)
- Standard section ordering: Activity Log → Action Items → Review → References → Someday → Notes
- Mixed content handling and edge cases

### 🔧 Implementation COMPLETED

1. ✅ **FormattingUtils constants** with comprehensive standards
2. ✅ **InferenceEngine updated** to use FormattingUtils for consistent output
3. ✅ **TrackerManager enhanced** with section placement and validation
4. ✅ **Formatting validation** prevents inconsistencies
5. ✅ **All generated entries** use new standards  
6. ✅ **Comprehensive tests** - 122 tests across 6 suites
7. ✅ **Legacy test compatibility** maintained
