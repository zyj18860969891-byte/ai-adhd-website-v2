- **Agent Editor**: Built-in editor with color customization for agent metadata
- **Global & Project Agents**: Support for both project-specific and global agent definitions
- **One-Click AI Instructions**: Click the robot emoji to copy agent-specific instructions to clipboard
- **Agent List AI Instructions**: New AI Instruction column in agent list with robot emoji (🤖) that copies `use subagent [agent-name] located in [path]:` for direct use in Claude
- **Agent Information Modal**: Detailed agent information with navigation between agents
- **Metadata Integration**: Agent assignments saved directly to tasks.json
- **Color Coding**: Visual differentiation of agents using custom colors

#### Agent Assignment Workflow:

### 💬 AI Chat Agent
**Context-aware AI assistant that adapts to your current project and task**

The Task Viewer now includes an integrated AI Chat Agent that helps you understand and query the tasks that have been planned and implemented by the AI (SHRIMP/Claude). As the AI handles the actual implementation of tasks, this chat interface serves as your window into understanding what has been planned, why certain decisions were made, and the current progress of the AI's work. The chat agent is fully context-aware, automatically adapting its knowledge base as you switch between projects and view different tasks.

Key features include:

- **Agent Selection**: Choose which AI agent to chat with by checking the appropriate checkbox in the chat window
  - Select from available agents like OpenAI GPT-4, architect, fullstack, backend, debugging, etc.
  - Each agent brings specialized knowledge for different types of queries
  - Easily switch between agents depending on your needs
- **Context-Aware Assistance**: The chat agent automatically updates its context based on:
  - The current project you're viewing
  - The task list currently displayed
  - The specific task you're examining in detail view
- **Task Insights**: Query the AI-generated task list to understand what has been planned and why
- **Plan Understanding**: Get clarification on the AI's implementation strategy and task breakdown
- **Expandable Interface**: Three viewing modes for optimal workflow:
  - **Collapsed**: Minimized to a small chat bubble for minimal screen usage
  - **Expanded**: Standard chat window for regular interactions
  - **Floating**: Draggable window that can be positioned anywhere on screen
- **Transparent Background**: Option to make the chat window transparent for better visibility of underlying content
- **Persistent Settings**: Your chat preferences (size, position, transparency) are saved across sessions
- **Smart Context Display**: Shows current context (project name, task count, current task) at the top of the chat

#### Use Cases:
- **Task Analysis**: "What are the high-priority tasks that the AI has planned?"
- **Understanding AI's Plan**: "Explain what the AI intends to do in task #5"
- **Task Dependencies**: "Which tasks did the AI mark as prerequisites for this one?"
- **Progress Review**: "What tasks has the AI completed so far in this project?"
- **Planning Insights**: "Why did the AI break down this feature into these specific tasks?"
- **Task Clarification**: "What does the AI mean by 'refactor authentication module' in task #8?"

The chat agent seamlessly integrates with the Task Viewer interface, providing real-time assistance without disrupting your workflow. As you navigate between projects and tasks, the agent automatically updates its understanding, ensuring relevant and contextual responses.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Bulk Agent Assignment
**Automatically assign the most appropriate agents to multiple tasks using OpenAI GPT-4**

The Task Viewer now integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4 to intelligently assign agents to tasks based on their descriptions and requirements. This feature dramatically reduces the time needed to configure large numbers of tasks with appropriate agents.

Key features include:

### 📊 Git Version Control for Task History
**Automatic Git commits track every change to your tasks**

The SHRIMP-TASK-MANAGER now includes built-in Git integration that automatically tracks all changes to your tasks.json file. This provides a complete audit trail of task modifications without any manual intervention.

Key features include:

- **Automatic Git Repository**: Initializes a Git repository in your data directory on first use
- **Timestamped Commits**: Every task operation (create, update, delete) creates a commit with local timezone timestamps
- **Descriptive Messages**: Commits include clear descriptions of what changed (e.g., "Add new task: Implement user authentication")
- **Non-Blocking**: Git operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks - if Git fails, task operations continue normally
- **Isolated Repository**: The Git repo is only for task history, completely separate from your project repository
- **No Merge Conflicts**: Single file tracking with linear history means no conflicts possible

#### Benefits:
- **Complete History**: Review the entire evolution of your tasks using standard Git tools
- **Change Tracking**: See exactly when and how tasks were modified
- **Recovery Options**: Restore previous task states if needed
- **Team Visibility**: Share task history with team members

The Git integration is completely transparent and requires no configuration. You can view the history at any time using:
```bash
cd <shrimp-data-directory>
git log --oneline
```

#### How to View Task History

1. **Navigate to your task data directory** (as configured in your `.mcp.json`):
   ```bash
   cd <shrimp-data-directory>
   ```

2. **View commit history**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

3. **See specific changes**:
   ```bash
   git show <commit-hash>
   ```

4. **Compare versions**:
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD~5  # Compare with 5 commits ago
   ```

5. **Restore previous state** (if needed):
   ```bash
   git checkout <commit-hash> -- tasks.json
   ```

### 📊 Project History View
**Track and analyze your project's task execution history**

The SHRIMP-TASK-MANAGER automatically saves completed tasks to memory files within your project whenever you start a new task session. Previously, this valuable historical data was hidden in these memory files and inaccessible through the UI. The new Project History View exposes this task history, allowing you to explore how your project evolved over time.

This feature enables you to:

- **Historical Task Snapshots**: Browse through past states of your project saved by SHRIMP-TASK-MANAGER
- **Task Evolution Tracking**: See how tasks progressed from creation to completion across different sessions
- **Notes System**: Add personal notes to historical entries for future reference and team knowledge sharing
- **Detailed Task View**: Drill down into specific historical task states to understand past decisions and implementations
- **Time-based Navigation**: Navigate through your project's timeline to see what was accomplished when
- **Snapshot Comparison**: Compare task states across different time periods to track project growth and changes

### 🎨 Template Management System
**Powerful template customization for AI task execution**

Templates are the core instructions that guide the SHRIMP-TASK-MANAGER in analyzing and executing tasks. They define how the AI should approach different types of operations, from planning and analysis to implementation and verification. The MCP-TASK-MANAGER allows for custom templates that can either override default behaviors or append additional instructions to existing templates.

This new Template Management interface provides an intuitive way to:

- **Template Editor**: Full-featured markdown editor with syntax highlighting for crafting custom AI instructions
- **Template Preview**: Live preview of templates before activation to ensure they meet your requirements
- **Template Duplication**: Create variations of existing templates easily for different use cases
- **Template Status Tracking**: Visual indicators showing Default (original), Custom (completely replaced), and Custom+Append (additions to default) states
- **Reset to Default**: One-click restoration of original templates when needed
- **Export Templates**: Export your custom templates for backup, sharing with team members, or version control
- **Activation Dialog**: Clear confirmation when activating templates to prevent accidental changes
